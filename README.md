## Probenecid-Rifampicin-DDI
Modeling of published clinical Probenecid-Rifampicin-DDI studies for model evaluation
 
### Repository files
Within this repository, we share a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the probeneicd model regarding the Probenecid-Rifampicin-DDI, including the respective observed data. The applied [rifampicin](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Rifampicin-Model) model has been published previously [[1](#reference)]. For further details and documentation please refer to [[2](#reference)].
 
### Version information
PK-Sim Version 8.0.

### Code of conduct

Everyone interacting in the Open Systems Pharmacology community (codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms, mailing lists etc...) is expected to follow the Open Systems Pharmacology code of conduct.

### Contribution
